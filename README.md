# Industrial Equipment Monitoring System 🚀

## Overview
This project is an **Industrial Equipment Monitoring System** developed as an **Open-Ended Lab (OEL)** project for the course **Computer and Programming** under the supervision of **Dr. Amna Shabbir** at NED University's Electronics Department.  

The system tracks and manages the operational and maintenance status of various machines in an industrial environment.

## Features ✨

1. **Machine Management**
   - Add new machines to the system.
   - Remove machines using their unique Machine ID.
   - Search for a specific machine by its ID.

2. **Operational and Maintenance Status**
   - Update a machine's operational status (RUNNING or NOT RUNNING).
   - Indicate whether a machine requires maintenance.

3. **Data Storage**
   - Save machine data to a file to ensure persistence between program runs.
   - Automatically load machine data from the file when the program starts.

4. **User-Friendly Menu**
   - Interactive menu system with options for adding, removing, updating, and viewing machines.
   - Clear prompts and messages to guide users.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Validation for numeric inputs such as Machine ID.
   - Appropriate feedback for invalid entries.
